### Slide Show M102: MongoDB for DBAs

Slide show created from taking screenshots of the course videos. Fiber networks load the slides in a jiffy. Slower connections may take a minute or two. Once loaded, browser refreshes bring the slides quickly back up until the cache is cleared.

If the repository is downloaded for localhost use, nodejs must be installed. Run 'npm install' so npm can install the dependencies from package.json. Then, start 'slideShowSrv.js' in the Server directory and point your browser to Client/index.html.

Works well with Chrome and Firefox.

### Bookmarks

To add a bookmark, navigate to the desired slide and hover over the 'B'. If the slide has not yet been bookmarked, the option to 'add bookmark' will be shown. If the slide has already been bookmarked, the option to 'del bookmark' will be shown. Bookmarks are saved as cookies.
